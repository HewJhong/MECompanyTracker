# Problem
Tracking outreach status for hundreds of companies is time-consuming and error-prone. Committees are also not committed to update the progress frequently, which leads to information getting stale. 

# Background
## Current Process
1. Committees will be assigned a number of companies to outreach to.
2. Committees will update the progress for each company in a shared Google Sheet.
3. When we want to check the overall progress of the entire outreach, or the progress of a particular committee, we will have to manually check the Google Sheet.
4. Since the Google Sheet is not updated frequently enough, there will be a gap between the actual email replies and the status. 
5. Committees will need to rely on checking their mailbox frequently to get the latest updates.
6. The higher committees are unable to know the actual progress of the outreach.
7. Note, I will provide a sample of the Google Sheet that is currently being used.
